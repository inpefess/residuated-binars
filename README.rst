Generating Algebraic Structures with Isabelle
==============================================

If you're looking for a reproducible example for AITP 2021 paper, find it `here <https://residuated-binars.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aitp2021.html>`__.

This packages serves for generating and validating examples of different algebraic structures using `Isabelle proof assistant <https://isabelle.in.tum.de>`__.

How to Install
===============

-  make sure that an installation of Isabelle is on the ``$PATH``
-  ``git clone https://github.com/inpefess/residuated-binars.git``
-  switch to Python 3.7+ environment with ``poetry`` installed
-  ``poetry install`` from the projectâ€™s root

Alternatively, one can use Docker:

.. code:: sh

      docker build -t residuated-binars https://github.com/inpefess/residuated-binars.git
      docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 residuated-binars jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser

Finally, one can run it on
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inpefess/residuated-binars/HEAD?labpath=reproduce-residuated-binars-papers.ipynb>`__
