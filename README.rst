========================================================

This repo generates counter-examples for inter-relations between
abstract distributivity laws in residuated binars with involution.

Running this code
=================

-  an installation of `Isabelle proof
   assistant <https://isabelle.in.tum.de>`__ is on the ``$PATH``
-  switch to Python 3.9 environment with ``poetry`` installed
-  ``poetry install`` from the projectâ€™s root
-  ``python residuated_binars/use_nitpick.py`` or a similar command from
   another working directory

Alternatively, one can use Docker:

.. code:: sh

      docker build -t residuated-binars https://github.com/inpefess/residuated-binars.git
      docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 residuated-binars jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser

and then navigate to ``residuated-binars-example.ipynb``.

Finally, one can run it on
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inpefess/residuated-binars/HEAD?labpath=residuated-binars-example.ipynb>`__
